            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Understanding Emergency vs. Non-Emergency Situations</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Not all health concerns require immediate emergency care, but knowing the difference can help you respond appropriately. Emergency situations are those that could be life-threatening or cause permanent damage if not addressed immediately. Non-emergency situations still require veterinary attention but can typically wait for a scheduled appointment.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              When in doubt, it's always better to err on the side of caution and contact your veterinarian or emergency clinic. They can help you determine whether your pet needs immediate care or can wait for a regular appointment.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Life-Threatening Emergency Signs</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              These signs require immediate emergency veterinary care. Do not wait - contact your veterinarian or emergency clinic right away:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Difficulty Breathing</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Signs of breathing problems include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Rapid, shallow, or labored breathing</li>
              <li>Open-mouth breathing in cats (cats rarely pant like dogs)</li>
              <li>Blue or pale gums</li>
              <li>Gasping for air</li>
              <li>Wheezing or choking sounds</li>
              <li>Inability to catch breath</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Breathing problems can indicate serious conditions like heart failure, respiratory disease, or airway obstruction and require immediate attention.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Collapse or Unconsciousness</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">If your pet collapses or loses consciousness:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>This is always an emergency</li>
              <li>Can indicate heart problems, severe illness, or trauma</li>
              <li>Requires immediate veterinary care</li>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Severe Bleeding</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Seek immediate care for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Bleeding that won't stop with direct pressure</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Apply direct pressure while transporting to a veterinarian. Do not remove impaled objects - stabilize them and seek immediate care.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Inability to Urinate (Especially Male Cats)</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">This is a life-threatening emergency, especially in male cats:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Straining to urinate with little or no urine produced</li>
              <li>Frequent attempts to urinate</li>
              <li>Signs of pain or distress</li>

            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">This requires immediate emergency veterinary care - do not wait.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Seizures</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Seek immediate care if:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Seizure lasts more than a few minutes</li>
              <li>Multiple seizures occur in a short time</li>
              <li>Your pet doesn't recover between seizures</li>
              <li>It's your pet's first seizure</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Even single, brief seizures should be evaluated by a veterinarian as soon as possible.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">Common Signs Requiring Veterinary Attention</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              These signs indicate your pet needs veterinary care. While not always emergencies, they should be addressed promptly:
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Loss of Appetite</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">When to be concerned:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Complete loss of appetite for more than 24 hours</li>
              <li>Reduced appetite lasting more than 2-3 days</li>
              <li>Loss of appetite combined with other symptoms</li>
              <li>Sudden change in eating habits</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">While a single missed meal may not be concerning, persistent loss of appetite can indicate serious health problems and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Vomiting or Diarrhea</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Seek veterinary care if:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Vomiting or diarrhea persists for more than 24 hours</li>
              <li>Blood is present in vomit or stool</li>
              <li>Your pet appears dehydrated (dry gums, sunken eyes, lethargy)</li>
              <li>Vomiting or diarrhea is severe or frequent</li>
              <li>Accompanied by other symptoms like lethargy or loss of appetite</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Occasional vomiting or diarrhea may not be serious, but persistent or severe cases require veterinary attention.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Lethargy or Unusual Behavior</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Watch for:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Unusual tiredness or lack of energy</li>
              <li>Reluctance to move or exercise</li>
              <li>Hiding or withdrawal from normal activities</li>
              <li>Changes in personality or behavior</li>
              <li>Confusion or disorientation</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">While some lethargy can be normal (after exercise, in hot weather), persistent or severe lethargy, especially combined with other symptoms, warrants veterinary evaluation.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Difficulty Urinating or Defecating</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Seek care if your pet:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Strains to urinate or defecate</li>
              <li>Cries or shows pain when urinating or defecating</li>

              <li>Urinates or defecates more or less frequently than normal</li>
              <li>Has accidents in the house (if previously house-trained)</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Remember: inability to urinate in male cats is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate care.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Excessive Drinking or Urination</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Increased thirst and urination can indicate:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Diabetes</li>
              <li>Kidney disease</li>
              <li>Urinary tract infections</li>
              <li>Hormonal disorders</li>
              <li>Other serious health conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">If you notice a significant increase in drinking or urination, schedule a veterinary appointment for evaluation.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Visible Pain or Discomfort</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Signs of pain include:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Limping or favoring a limb</li>
              <li>Reluctance to move or jump</li>
              <li>Vocalizing (whining, crying, growling)</li>
              <li>Changes in posture or movement</li>
              <li>Guarding a body part</li>
              <li>Aggression when touched in a specific area</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Do not give human pain medications to pets - many are toxic. Contact your veterinarian for appropriate pain management.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Changes in Breathing Patterns</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Be concerned if you notice:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Rapid or shallow breathing at rest</li>
              <li>Coughing that persists</li>

              <li>Open-mouth breathing in cats</li>
              <li>Blue or pale gums</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Any breathing difficulties should be evaluated promptly, as they can indicate serious respiratory or cardiac problems.</p>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-6 mb-3">Changes in Weight</h3>
            <p className="mb-3">Unexplained weight changes can indicate health problems:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-2">
              <li>Sudden weight loss (especially if eating normally)</li>
              <li>Rapid weight gain</li>
              <li>Changes in body condition</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">Weight changes, especially when combined with other symptoms, should be evaluated by a veterinarian.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mt-8 mb-4">When to Schedule a Regular Appointment</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Some symptoms, while not emergencies, still require veterinary attention. Schedule an appointment if your pet shows:

              <li>Mild digestive issues that persist for more than 24-48 hours</li>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">What are the most urgent signs that my pet needs immediate veterinary care?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Seek immediate emergency care for difficulty breathing, collapse or unconsciousness, severe trauma, seizures, severe bleeding, suspected poisoning, inability to urinate (especially in male cats), severe vomiting or diarrhea with blood, or signs of extreme pain. These are life-threatening situations requiring immediate attention. Do not delay - contact your veterinarian or emergency clinic right away.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">How long should I wait before taking my pet to the vet for symptoms?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">For severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, collapse, or severe bleeding, seek immediate care - do not wait. For milder symptoms like loss of appetite, lethargy, or mild digestive issues, if they persist more than 24-48 hours, schedule a veterinary appointment. When in doubt, it's always better to consult with your veterinarian sooner rather than later. Early intervention often leads to better outcomes.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">What are common signs of illness in pets that require veterinary attention?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Common signs include loss of appetite lasting more than 24 hours, persistent vomiting or diarrhea, lethargy or unusual behavior, difficulty urinating or defecating, excessive drinking or urination, visible pain or discomfort, changes in breathing patterns, coughing or sneezing, changes in weight, and any sudden behavioral changes. If you notice any of these signs, especially if they persist or worsen, consult with your veterinarian.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">Should I take my pet to the vet for minor symptoms?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">Minor symptoms that resolve quickly may not require immediate veterinary care, but if symptoms persist, worsen, or you're concerned, it's always best to consult with your veterinarian. Some seemingly minor symptoms can indicate underlying serious conditions. Your veterinarian can help determine if treatment is needed. It's better to be cautious and have minor symptoms checked than to miss something serious.</p>

                  <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-2">What should I do if my pet is showing signs of pain?</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">If your pet is showing signs of pain, contact your veterinarian. Signs of pain include limping, reluctance to move, vocalizing, changes in behavior, loss of appetite, or guarding a body part. Do not give human pain medications to pets, as many are toxic and can cause serious harm or death. Your veterinarian can provide safe and appropriate pain management based on your pet's specific needs.</p>

If your pet cannot wait for a regular appointment, it's an emergency. When in doubt, contact your veterinarian or emergency clinic for guidance. They can help you determine whether immediate care is needed or if you can schedule a regular appointment.</p>
