Be gentle and let your pet's response guide you. Brushing should be comfortable for your pet. If your pet seems uncomfortable, use lighter pressure or a different brush."
vetNote: "If your pet has severe mats, skin irritation, or other coat problems, consult your veterinarian or a professional groomer. Severe mats can cause skin problems and may need professional removal. Skin irritation or other issues may indicate underlying health problems. Regular grooming is important for your pet's health and comfort."
