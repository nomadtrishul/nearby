## Why Recognizing Symptoms Matters

Being able to recognize symptoms that require veterinary attention is crucial for your pet's health and wellbeing. Pets can't tell us when they're feeling unwell, so it's up to us to notice changes and seek appropriate care. Early detection and treatment of health problems are often more effective and less expensive than waiting until problems become severe. Knowing what to look for helps you make informed decisions about when to seek veterinary care.

Understanding what's normal for your pet and what's concerning helps you recognize problems early. Some symptoms are obvious emergencies, while others may be more subtle. Learning to recognize both obvious and subtle signs of illness helps ensure your pet gets the care they need when they need it. This knowledge is an important part of responsible pet ownership.

## Recognizing Emergency Symptoms

Some symptoms are clear emergencies that require immediate veterinary attention. Knowing these signs helps you act quickly when every minute counts.

Know the signs that require immediate veterinary care. These are symptoms that indicate life-threatening situations. Don't delay seeking care for these symptoms—time is critical.

Difficulty breathing or choking is always an emergency. If your pet is having trouble breathing, is choking, or is showing signs of respiratory distress, seek immediate care. Respiratory problems can quickly become life-threatening.

Unconsciousness or collapse requires immediate attention. If your pet loses consciousness or collapses, this is a serious emergency. Get to a veterinarian immediately.

Severe bleeding that won't stop needs immediate care. While minor bleeding can often be managed, severe bleeding that won't stop with pressure is an emergency. Maintain pressure and get to a veterinarian immediately.

Seizures are emergencies, especially if they're prolonged or if your pet has multiple seizures. Seizures can be life-threatening and need immediate veterinary attention.

Inability to urinate is always an emergency, especially in male cats, as it can indicate a life-threatening blockage. This is a critical emergency that needs immediate attention.

Bloated or distended abdomen, especially if it comes on suddenly, can indicate a life-threatening condition like bloat. This is an emergency that needs immediate attention.

Severe trauma, such as being hit by a car or falling from a height, needs immediate veterinary attention, even if your pet seems okay initially. Internal injuries may not be immediately apparent.

Suspected poisoning requires immediate attention. If you suspect your pet has ingested something toxic, contact your veterinarian or poison control immediately. Don't wait for symptoms to appear.

Extreme pain, indicated by vocalization, inability to move, or other severe signs, needs immediate attention. Pain can indicate serious problems and needs prompt treatment.

These are life-threatening emergencies that need immediate attention. Don't delay seeking care for these symptoms. Time is critical in emergencies, and prompt care can make the difference between life and death.

Don't delay seeking care for these symptoms. When you see emergency signs, don't wait to see if things improve—seek immediate veterinary care. It's better to seek care and find out it's not an emergency than to wait and have a problem worsen.

Time is critical in emergencies. The sooner emergency care begins, the better the outcome. Don't hesitate to seek immediate care for emergency symptoms.
