    text: "Puppies/Kittens (under 6 months): Need 3-4 meals daily for growth and stable blood sugar. Adult pets: Dogs do best with 2 meals daily, cats prefer 2-4 smaller meals. Senior pets: May need 2-3 smaller meals for easier digestion. Adjust based on your pet's individual needs."

  - name: "Establish Consistent Meal Times"
    text: "Choose specific times that work for your schedule and stick to them. Example for dogs: 7 AM and 6 PM. Example for cats: 7 AM, 12 PM, 6 PM, 10 PM. Consistency helps regulate metabolism, reduces anxiety, and makes house-training easier. Feed at the same times every day, including weekends."
    duration: "PT1W"
  - name: "Create Morning Feeding Routine"
    text: "Feed first meal in the morning, ideally after your pet's morning routine (potty break, exercise). For dogs, morning meal can be after morning walk. For cats, morning meal can start their day. Keep timing consistent - within 30 minutes of the same time daily."
    duration: "PT1W"
  - name: "Schedule Evening Feeding"
    text: "Feed evening meal 8-12 hours after morning meal for dogs. For cats, space meals throughout the day. Evening meal should be early enough for digestion before bedtime (2-3 hours before sleep). This helps prevent overnight hunger and supports better sleep."
    duration: "PT1W"
  - name: "Adjust for Your Lifestyle"
    text: "Adapt schedule to your routine: If you work late, feed later. If you're an early riser, feed earlier. Use automatic feeders if needed for consistency. Ensure someone can feed if you're away. The key is consistency within your lifestyle constraints."
    duration: "PT1W"
  - name: "Monitor and Adjust as Needed"
    text: "Watch your pet's behavior: Are they hungry between meals? Do they eat too quickly? Are they leaving food? Adjust meal times or frequency based on your pet's response. Some pets do better with different schedules. Be flexible while maintaining consistency."

faq:
  - question: "How many times a day should I feed my dog?"
    answer: "Most adult dogs do best with 2 meals per day, spaced 8-12 hours apart (e.g., 7 AM and 6 PM). Puppies need 3-4 meals daily, while seniors may benefit from 2-3 smaller meals. The exact schedule depends on your dog's age, health, and your lifestyle."
  - question: "How many times a day should I feed my cat?"
    answer: "Cats prefer 2-4 smaller meals throughout the day. Some cats do well with 2 meals (morning and evening), while others prefer 3-4 meals. Indoor cats often benefit from more frequent, smaller meals. Kittens need 3-4 meals daily, while seniors may need 2-3 meals."
  - question: "What time should I feed my pet in the morning?"
    answer: "Feed your pet in the morning at a consistent time that works for your schedule, ideally after their morning routine (potty break, exercise). Common times are 6-8 AM. The key is consistency - feed at the same time every day, within a 30-minute window."
  - question: "Is it better to feed pets before or after exercise?"
    answer: "For dogs, it's generally better to feed after exercise to prevent bloat (especially in large breeds) and allow for digestion. However, a small meal before light exercise is usually fine. Avoid feeding immediately before or after intense exercise. For cats, timing is less critical."
  - question: "Can I free-feed my pet?"
    answer: "Free-feeding (leaving food out all day) is not recommended for most pets as it leads to overeating and obesity. However, some cats can self-regulate. If free-feeding, monitor weight closely and switch to scheduled meals if your pet gains weight. Most pets benefit from scheduled meals."
  - question: "What if I can't feed at the same times every day?"
    answer: "Consistency is ideal, but life happens. Use automatic feeders for consistency when you can't be there. Try to maintain the same schedule most days. If your schedule varies, feed within a 1-2 hour window. Some consistency is better than none. Consider pet sitters or automatic feeders for irregular schedules."
vetNote: "Feeding schedules should be adjusted based on your pet's health conditions. Pets with diabetes need consistent meal times for insulin management. Pets with gastrointestinal issues may benefit from more frequent, smaller meals. Consult your veterinarian for specific feeding schedule recommendations based on your pet's health needs."
