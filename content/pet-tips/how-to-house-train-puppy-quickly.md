  - question: "What if my puppy keeps having accidents?"
    answer: "If your puppy keeps having accidents, increase supervision, take them out more frequently, and ensure you're cleaning accidents thoroughly with an enzyme cleaner. Make sure your schedule is consistent. If accidents persist despite consistent effort, consult your veterinarian to rule out medical issues. Some puppies may need more time or a different approach."
vetNote: "If your puppy is having frequent accidents despite consistent house training efforts, or if you notice other concerning symptoms, consult your veterinarian. Medical issues like urinary tract infections or other problems can cause house training difficulties. Your veterinarian can rule out medical causes and provide guidance on house training."
