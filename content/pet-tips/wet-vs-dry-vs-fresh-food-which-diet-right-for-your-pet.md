faq:
  - question: "Is wet food better than dry food for pets?"
    answer: "Neither is inherently better - both can be nutritionally complete. Wet food has higher moisture (beneficial for hydration), while dry food is more cost-effective and convenient. The best choice depends on your pet's specific needs, health conditions, and your preferences. Many pets do well on a combination."
  - question: "Should I feed my cat wet or dry food?"
    answer: "Cats often benefit from wet food due to their low thirst drive and risk of dehydration. However, many cats do well on dry food or a combination. Cats with kidney issues, urinary problems, or low water intake should prioritize wet food. Consult your veterinarian for specific recommendations."
  - question: "Is fresh food worth the extra cost?"
    answer: "Fresh food offers high-quality ingredients and less processing, but it's significantly more expensive ($100-200/month vs $30-60 for dry). Whether it's worth it depends on your budget, pet's health needs, and priorities. Many pets thrive on quality commercial dry or wet foods."
  - question: "Can I mix wet and dry food?"
    answer: "Yes, mixing wet and dry food is common and can provide benefits of both: hydration from wet food, dental benefits and convenience from dry food. Adjust portions to account for calories from both. Ensure both foods are nutritionally complete and appropriate for your pet's life stage."
  - question: "How much more expensive is fresh food?"
    answer: "Fresh food typically costs 2-4x more than dry food. For a medium dog: dry food $30-60/month, wet food $60-120/month, fresh food $100-200+/month. Costs vary by brand, pet size, and location. Consider your budget and whether the benefits justify the cost for your situation."
  - question: "Which food type is best for dental health?"
    answer: "Dry food (kibble) is generally better for dental health as the crunchy texture helps scrape plaque. However, dental health depends more on regular brushing and dental care than food type. Wet and fresh foods don't provide the same mechanical cleaning, but can be supplemented with dental treats or chews."
vetNote: "The best food type depends on your pet's individual needs. Pets with kidney disease, diabetes, or urinary issues may benefit from specific food types. Consult your veterinarian to determine the best diet for your pet's health conditions, age, and lifestyle. Quality and nutritional completeness matter more than food type."
