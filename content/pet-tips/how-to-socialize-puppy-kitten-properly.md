  - question: "What if my pet has a negative experience during socialization?"
    answer: "If your pet has a negative experience, don't panic—one negative experience doesn't necessarily ruin socialization.

If your pet shows lasting effects from a negative experience, consult a professional."
vetNote: "Ensure your pet is healthy and has received appropriate vaccinations before socializing, especially with other animals. Consult your veterinarian about when it's safe to begin socializing your pet.

Your veterinarian can provide guidance on safe socialization practices."
