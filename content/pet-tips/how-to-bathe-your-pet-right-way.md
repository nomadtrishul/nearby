faq:
  - question: "How often should I bathe my pet?"
    answer: "Bathing frequency depends on your pet's needs. Most pets don't need frequent bathing—every 4-6 weeks is often sufficient, unless they get dirty or have a specific need. Over-bathing can strip natural oils and cause skin problems. However, some pets with skin conditions may need more frequent bathing with medicated shampoos as recommended by a veterinarian. Consult your veterinarian about appropriate bathing frequency for your pet."
  - question: "Can I use human shampoo on my pet?"
    answer: "No, never use human shampoo on pets. Human shampoo is formulated for human skin pH and can be too harsh for pets, potentially causing skin irritation, dryness, or other problems. Always use shampoo specifically formulated for pets. Pet shampoos are designed for pet skin pH and are safer for your pet's skin and coat."
  - question: "What water temperature should I use?"
    answer: "Use lukewarm water—comfortable to the touch, not hot or cold. Test the water temperature with your wrist before wetting your pet. Water that feels comfortable to you should be comfortable for your pet. Avoid hot water, as it can burn or irritate the skin. Cold water can be uncomfortable and stressful. The right temperature makes bathing more comfortable."
  - question: "How do I keep water out of my pet's ears?"
    answer: "To keep water out of ears, avoid wetting the head area, or use a damp cloth to clean the face instead of spraying water. You can also place cotton balls gently in the ears (don't push them in), but remove them after bathing. Be careful around the ears, and if water does get in, gently dry the outer ear. Some pets are more prone to ear problems, so be extra careful."
  - question: "What if my pet is afraid of baths?"
    answer: "If your pet is afraid of baths, introduce bathing gradually. Start by just getting them comfortable with the bathing area, then gradually introduce water. Use positive reinforcement with treats and praise. Keep initial baths short and positive. Don't force it—go at your pet's pace. Some pets may need professional help or gradual desensitization to become comfortable with bathing."
  - question: "Should I brush my pet before or after bathing?"
    answer: "Brush your pet before bathing to remove loose hair and tangles. Bathing can make tangles worse, so it's better to remove them first. After bathing, you can gently brush once the coat is dry to smooth it and check for any remaining tangles. Brushing before bathing makes the bath more effective and prevents tangles from becoming worse."
  - question: "How do I know if I've rinsed all the shampoo out?"
    answer: "Rinse until the water runs clear and there's no soapy residue. Feel the coat—it should feel clean, not slippery or soapy. Incomplete rinsing can leave residue that causes skin irritation. Take your time to rinse thoroughly, checking different areas of the coat. Thorough rinsing is essential for preventing skin problems."
vetNote: "If your pet has skin problems, allergies, or other health issues, consult your veterinarian about appropriate bathing products and frequency. Some pets may need medicated shampoos or specific bathing protocols. Over-bathing or using inappropriate products can cause skin problems. Your veterinarian can recommend appropriate products and bathing schedules for your pet's specific needs."
