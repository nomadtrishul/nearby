  - name: "Identify Your Pet's Life Stage"
    text: "Pets have changing nutritional needs at each life stage. **Puppies/Kittens:** Need more protein and calories. Puppies require 22–32% protein, while kittens need about 30% for healthy growth. **Adults:** Focus on balanced energy intake to maintain weight. **Seniors:** Require lower-calorie diets and added joint support nutrients."
    duration: "PT5M"
  - name: "Choose the Right Type of Food"
    text: "Select the appropriate food type for your pet. **Dry Kibble:** Cost-effective, good for dental health. **Wet Food:** High moisture, ideal for cats prone to dehydration. **Fresh Cooked Food:** Higher digestibility. **Raw Diet:** Growing trend, but must follow strict hygiene guidelines. A 2024 Mars Petcare survey showed 43% of pet owners are shifting toward fresh or minimally processed diets."
    duration: "PT5M"
  - name: "Check for AAFCO or FEDIAF Certification"
    text: "Always confirm the food label states \"Complete and Balanced\". This shows the diet meets scientific nutritional standards. AAFCO compliance ensures pets receive the essential nutrients required for maintenance, growth, and reproduction."
    duration: "PT3M"
  - name: "Understand Essential Nutrients"
    text: "A balanced diet contains: **Protein** – muscle, immune support. **Healthy fats** – skin and coat benefits. **Carbohydrates** – digestion and energy. **Vitamins & minerals** – cellular function. **Water** – pets need 50–60 ml per kg of body weight daily. Dehydration can affect up to 30% of indoor cats, especially those eating dry food only."
    duration: "PT5M"
  - name: "Avoid Harmful Foods"
    text: "Never feed your pet: Chocolate, Grapes & raisins, Onions & garlic, Xylitol, Alcohol and caffeine. The ASPCA notes over 17% of annual emergency calls are due to accidental ingestion of toxic foods."

    warning: "If your pet ingests any toxic food, contact your veterinarian or emergency pet clinic immediately."
  - name: "Set Proper Portion Size"
    text: "Use weight, activity level, and food type to determine quantity. **Simple guideline:** Most adult dogs need 25–30 calories per kg of body weight daily. Most adult cats require 40–45 calories per kg. Adjust portions every 2–4 weeks based on weight change."
    duration: "PT5M"
  - name: "Add Healthy Supplements When Needed"
    text: "Helpful supplements include: **Omega-3 (EPA & DHA)** – reduces inflammation. **Probiotics** – supports digestion. **Glucosamine & chondroitin** – senior joint support. **Multivitamins** (for homemade diets). Studies show omega-3 fatty acids reduce joint stiffness in dogs by up to 25%."

    warning: "If your pet shows signs of food allergies, consult your veterinarian before starting an elimination diet."
faq:
  - question: "Why is life-stage nutrition important for pets?"
    answer: "Life-stage nutrition is essential because a puppy's body uses nutrients differently than an adult's. Puppies and kittens need more protein and calories for growth, while seniors require lower-calorie diets with added joint support. Adults need balanced energy intake to maintain optimal weight."
  - question: "How do I know if my pet's food is nutritionally complete?"
    answer: "Look for AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials) or FEDIAF (European Pet Food Industry Federation) certification on the label. The label should state \"Complete and Balanced\" which indicates the diet meets scientific nutritional standards for your pet's life stage."
  - question: "What percentage of pets are overweight due to improper feeding?"
    answer: "According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, 61% of dogs and 59% of cats are overweight—mostly due to improper feeding. A structured nutrition plan prevents obesity and improves overall quality of life."
  - question: "How much water does my pet need daily?"
    answer: "Pets need 50–60 ml per kg of body weight daily. Dehydration can affect up to 30% of indoor cats, especially those eating dry food only. Always ensure fresh water is available at all times."
  - question: "What should I do if my pet shows signs of food allergies?"
    answer: "If your pet shows signs like loose stools, ear infections, itching, red skin patches, or vomiting after meals, consult your veterinarian. Food allergies affect 10–20% of dogs with chronic skin issues. Your vet may recommend a 6–8 week elimination diet to identify the allergen."
  - question: "How often should I adjust my pet's portion sizes?"
    answer: "Adjust portions every 2–4 weeks based on weight change. Most adult dogs need 25–30 calories per kg of body weight daily, while most adult cats require 40–45 calories per kg. Monitor your pet's body condition and adjust as needed."
vetNote: "If your pet shows signs of food allergies, persistent digestive issues, sudden weight changes, or if you're considering a raw or homemade diet, consult your veterinarian. They can help create a personalized nutrition plan and ensure your pet receives all essential nutrients. Emergency veterinary care is needed if your pet ingests toxic foods like chocolate, grapes, onions, or xylitol."
