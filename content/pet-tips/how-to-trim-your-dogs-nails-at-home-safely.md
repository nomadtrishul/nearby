faq:
  - question: "How often should I trim my dog's nails?"
    answer: "How often you trim depends on your dog's activity level and how quickly their nails grow. Most dogs need trimming every 2-4 weeks, but some may need it more or less frequently. Dogs who walk on hard surfaces regularly may need less frequent trimming, as the surfaces help wear down nails. Regular trimming is easier than waiting until nails are too long."
  - question: "What if I cut the quick?"
    answer: "If you cut the quick, don't panic. Apply styptic powder to stop the bleeding. Hold gentle pressure if needed. Most bleeding stops quickly. Comfort your dog and give them treats. Don't scold your dog—accidents happen. Take a break if needed, then continue when your dog is calm. The quick will recede as the nail grows, so you can trim closer next time."
  - question: "How do I know where to cut on dark nails?"
    answer: "On dark nails, the quick isn't visible, so you need to be more careful. Trim small amounts at a time. Look at the cut surface—if you see a dark dot in the center, you're getting close to the quick. Stop before you see the dot. It's better to trim less frequently with small cuts than to risk cutting the quick. When in doubt, trim less."
  - question: "What type of clippers should I use?"
    answer: "The type of clippers depends on your dog's size and nail thickness. Guillotine-style clippers work well for small to medium dogs with thinner nails. Scissor-style clippers work for larger dogs or thicker nails. Choose clippers that are sharp and in good condition. Dull clippers can crush the nail rather than cut it cleanly. The right tools make trimming easier and safer."
  - question: "What if my dog won't let me trim their nails?"
    answer: "If your dog resists, go back to earlier steps in the introduction process. Don't force it—this can create fear and make future trimming more difficult. Work on getting your dog comfortable with having their paws touched and with the clippers before attempting to trim. Use positive reinforcement and go at your dog's pace. Some dogs may need professional help or gradual desensitization."
  - question: "Should I trim the dewclaws?"
    answer: "Yes, dewclaws should be trimmed as well. Dewclaws don't touch the ground, so they don't wear down naturally and can grow too long. Trim them the same way as other nails, being careful to avoid the quick. Regular trimming of dewclaws prevents them from growing too long and causing problems."
  - question: "Can I use a nail grinder instead of clippers?"
    answer: "Yes, nail grinders can be used instead of clippers. Grinders file the nail down gradually, which some dogs prefer. However, they require gradual introduction as well, as the noise and vibration can be intimidating. Grinders can be good for dogs who are afraid of clippers or for smoothing rough edges after clipping. Choose what works best for you and your dog."
vetNote: "If you're uncomfortable trimming your dog's nails, or if your dog has very dark nails and you're concerned about cutting the quick, consult your veterinarian or a professional groomer. They can show you proper technique and help you become more comfortable. If you accidentally cut the quick and bleeding doesn't stop, or if you have concerns, contact your veterinarian. Regular nail trimming is important for your dog's health and comfort."
