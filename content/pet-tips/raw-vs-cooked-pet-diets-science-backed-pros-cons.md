    text: "Weigh pros and cons based on your situation. Consider consulting a board-certified veterinary nutritionist. If choosing raw, use commercial raw diets that are tested for pathogens, or work with a nutritionist. If choosing cooked, ensure proper supplementation and balance."
    duration: "PT5M"
faq:
  - question: "Are raw diets healthier than cooked diets for pets?"
    answer: "There's no definitive scientific evidence that raw diets are healthier. Some studies suggest potential benefits (shinier coats, smaller stools), but others show risks (bacterial contamination, nutritional imbalances). Both can be healthy if properly balanced, but both require careful formulation and veterinary oversight."
  - question: "What are the main risks of raw diets?"
    answer: "Main risks include: bacterial contamination (Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria) that can affect pets and humans, parasitic infections, nutritional imbalances leading to deficiencies or excesses, bone hazards (choking, dental fractures), and cross-contamination in the home. Studies show 20-30% of raw diets test positive for harmful bacteria."
  - question: "Do cooked diets lose nutritional value?"
    answer: "Cooking can destroy some heat-sensitive nutrients (certain enzymes, some B vitamins), but it also makes other nutrients more digestible and bioavailable. Properly formulated cooked diets with appropriate supplementation can be nutritionally complete. Many commercial cooked foods are AAFCO-approved and nutritionally balanced."
  - question: "Can I feed my pet a combination of raw and cooked food?"
    answer: "Mixing raw and cooked can be done, but it's complex. Different digestibility rates, potential for digestive upset, and maintaining nutritional balance become challenging. If mixing, work with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure proper balance and avoid gastrointestinal issues."
  - question: "Are commercial raw diets safer than homemade raw diets?"
    answer: "Commercial raw diets that are high-pressure processed (HPP) or freeze-dried are generally safer than homemade raw diets, as they're tested for pathogens. However, they're still not risk-free. Homemade raw diets require strict food safety protocols and nutritional expertise to be safe and complete."
  - question: "What does science say about raw vs cooked diets?"
    answer: "Scientific studies show mixed results. Some suggest potential benefits of raw diets (digestibility, coat quality), but most veterinary organizations (AVMA, AAHA) recommend caution due to safety concerns. Studies consistently show raw diets have higher bacterial contamination rates. More research is needed for definitive conclusions."
vetNote: "Both raw and cooked diets require veterinary oversight to ensure nutritional completeness and safety. Raw diets pose significant health risks to pets and humans. If you choose a raw diet, use commercial products that are pathogen-tested, or work with a board-certified veterinary nutritionist. Pets with compromised immune systems, very young or old pets, and households with high-risk individuals should avoid raw diets."
