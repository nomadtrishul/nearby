    text: "Consult your veterinarian to determine your pet's ideal weight. Use body condition scoring: ribs should be easily felt but not visible, waist should be visible from above, and abdomen should tuck up when viewed from the side. Ideal weight varies by breed and individual."
    duration: "PT5M"
  - name: "Calculate Resting Energy Requirement (RER)"
    text: "Calculate RER using the formula: RER = 70 × (ideal weight in kg)^0.75. This gives the calories needed for basic body functions at rest. For example, a 10kg dog: RER = 70 × (10)^0.75 = 70 × 5.62 = 393 calories per day."
    duration: "PT3M"
  - name: "Adjust for Activity Level and Life Stage"
    text: "Multiply RER by activity factor: Sedentary/obese: 1.2-1.4, Neutered adult: 1.6, Intact adult: 1.8, Active/working: 2.0-5.0, Puppy (4 months): 3.0, Puppy (adult size): 2.0, Senior: 1.1-1.4. This gives Daily Energy Requirement (DER)."
    duration: "PT2M"
  - name: "Check Food Calorie Content"
    text: "Find calories per cup or per 100g on your pet food label. Calorie content varies significantly between brands and food types. Dry food typically has 300-400 calories per cup, while wet food has 200-300 calories per can. Use this to calculate portions."

  - name: "Calculate Daily Portion Size"
    text: "Divide Daily Energy Requirement (DER) by calories per cup/can to get daily portion. Example: If DER is 800 calories and food has 400 calories/cup, feed 2 cups per day. Split into 2-3 meals for dogs, 2-4 meals for cats."
    duration: "PT2M"
  - name: "Measure Accurately"
    text: "Use a kitchen scale (most accurate) or proper measuring cup. Don't estimate or use random cups. Level off dry food, don't pack it down. For wet food, use the can or measure by weight. Consistency is key for portion control."

faq:
  - question: "How much should I feed my dog per day?"
    answer: "Most adult dogs need 25-30 calories per kg of ideal body weight per day. For example, a 20kg dog needs 500-600 calories daily. However, this varies by activity level, age, and metabolism. Use the RER calculation method for accuracy, or consult your veterinarian."
  - question: "How much should I feed my cat per day?"
    answer: "Most adult cats need 40-45 calories per kg of ideal body weight per day. For example, a 4kg cat needs 160-180 calories daily. Indoor cats typically need fewer calories than outdoor cats. Portion size also depends on food type (dry vs wet) and calorie density."
  - question: "Should I feed my pet once or twice a day?"
    answer: "Dogs typically do best with 2 meals per day, while cats prefer 2-4 smaller meals. Puppies and kittens need 3-4 meals daily. Multiple meals help maintain stable blood sugar, prevent overeating, and reduce the risk of bloat in large dogs."
  - question: "How do I know if I'm feeding too much or too little?"
    answer: "Monitor your pet's body condition: ribs should be easily felt but not visible, waist should be visible from above. If ribs are hard to feel or no waist is visible, reduce portions. If ribs are very visible or prominent, increase portions. Weigh monthly and adjust accordingly."
  - question: "Do I need to adjust portions for different food types?"
    answer: "Yes, calorie content varies significantly. Dry food typically has 300-400 calories per cup, wet food has 200-300 calories per can, and fresh/raw diets vary widely. Always check the calorie content on the label and adjust portions when switching foods."
  - question: "How often should I adjust my pet's portion size?"
    answer: "Weigh your pet monthly and adjust portions every 2-4 weeks if needed. Make gradual changes (10-20% at a time) rather than sudden large changes. Factors like season, activity level, and age may require periodic adjustments."
vetNote: "If your pet is significantly overweight or underweight, has health conditions, or you're unsure about proper portions, consult your veterinarian. They can help determine ideal weight, calculate precise calorie needs, and create a feeding plan. Rapid weight changes or difficulty maintaining weight may indicate underlying health issues."

## Why Portion Control Matters

Proper portion control is essential for your pet's health. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention, **61% of dogs and 59% of cats are overweight or obese**, primarily due to overfeeding. Correct portion sizes help maintain ideal weight, prevent obesity-related diseases, and ensure your pet receives adequate nutrition without excess calories.

## Understanding Your Pet's Calorie Needs

### Basic Calculation Method:

**Step 1: Resting Energy Requirement (RER)**
```
RER = 70 × (ideal weight in kg)^0.75
```

**Step 2: Daily Energy Requirement (DER)**
```
DER = RER × Activity Factor
```

### Activity Factors:

- **Sedentary/Obesity-prone:** 1.2-1.4
- **Neutered adult:** 1.6
- **Intact adult:** 1.8
- **Active/Working dogs:** 2.0-5.0
- **Puppy (4 months):** 3.0
- **Puppy (adult size):** 2.0
- **Senior (less active):** 1.1-1.4

## Portion Size Guidelines by Pet Type

### Dogs:

**Small Dogs (5-10 kg / 11-22 lbs):**
- Sedentary: 200-300 calories/day
- Active: 300-400 calories/day
- Portion: 1/2 - 1 cup dry food (depending on calorie density)

**Medium Dogs (15-25 kg / 33-55 lbs):**
- Sedentary: 600-800 calories/day
- Active: 900-1,200 calories/day
- Portion: 1.5 - 3 cups dry food

**Large Dogs (30-40 kg / 66-88 lbs):**
- Sedentary: 1,000-1,300 calories/day
- Active: 1,500-2,000 calories/day
- Portion: 3 - 5 cups dry food

**Giant Dogs (45+ kg / 99+ lbs):**
- Sedentary: 1,400-1,800 calories/day
- Active: 2,000-3,000+ calories/day
- Portion: 4 - 7+ cups dry food

### Cats:

**Small Cats (3-4 kg / 6.6-8.8 lbs):**
- Indoor: 160-200 calories/day
- Outdoor: 200-240 calories/day
- Portion: 1/3 - 1/2 cup dry food OR 1-1.5 cans wet food

**Medium Cats (4-5 kg / 8.8-11 lbs):**
- Indoor: 200-250 calories/day
- Outdoor: 250-300 calories/day
- Portion: 1/2 - 2/3 cup dry food OR 1.5-2 cans wet food

**Large Cats (5-6 kg / 11-13 lbs):**
- Indoor: 250-300 calories/day
- Outdoor: 300-350 calories/day
- Portion: 2/3 - 1 cup dry food OR 2-2.5 cans wet food

## Factors Affecting Portion Size

### 1. Age and Life Stage:

**Puppies/Kittens:**
- Need 2-3x more calories per kg than adults
- Feed 3-4 times daily
- Portions increase as they grow
- Monitor growth rate

**Adults:**
- Maintain weight with calculated portions
- Feed 2 times daily (dogs) or 2-4 times (cats)
- Adjust for activity level

**Seniors:**
- May need 10-20% fewer calories
- Less active, slower metabolism
- May need more frequent, smaller meals
- Monitor for weight gain

### 2. Activity Level:

**Sedentary/Indoor:**
- Lower calorie needs
- Reduce portions by 10-20%
- Monitor weight closely

**Moderately Active:**
- Standard calorie calculations apply
- Regular exercise routine
- Maintain portions

**Highly Active/Working:**
- May need 2-3x more calories
- Increase portions significantly
- Monitor body condition

### 3. Body Condition:

**Underweight:**
- Increase portions by 10-20%
- Feed higher calorie food
- More frequent meals
- Veterinary check recommended

**Ideal Weight:**
- Maintain current portions
- Monitor monthly
- Adjust for activity changes

**Overweight:**
- Reduce portions by 10-20%
- Lower calorie food option
- Increase exercise
- Veterinary weight loss plan

### 4. Food Type and Calorie Density:

**Dry Food (Kibble):**
- 300-400 calories per cup
- More calorie-dense
- Smaller portions needed
- Good for dental health

**Wet Food (Canned):**
- 200-300 calories per can
- Less calorie-dense
- Larger portions needed
- Higher moisture content

**Fresh/Raw Food:**
- Varies widely (200-500 calories per cup)
- Check label carefully
- May need larger portions
- Higher digestibility

## Portion Size Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Medium Dog (20 kg, neutered, moderately active)

**Step 1: Calculate RER**
```
RER = 70 × (20)^0.75
RER = 70 × 9.46
RER = 662 calories
```

**Step 2: Calculate DER**
```
DER = 662 × 1.6 (neutered adult)
DER = 1,059 calories/day
```

**Step 3: Calculate Portions**
- If food has 400 calories/cup: 1,059 ÷ 400 = 2.65 cups/day
- Split into 2 meals: ~1.3 cups per meal

### Example 2: Indoor Cat (4.5 kg, spayed, sedentary)

**Step 1: Calculate RER**
```
RER = 70 × (4.5)^0.75
RER = 70 × 3.36
RER = 235 calories
```

**Step 2: Calculate DER**
```
DER = 235 × 1.2 (sedentary/spayed)
DER = 282 calories/day
```

**Step 3: Calculate Portions**
- If dry food has 350 calories/cup: 282 ÷ 350 = 0.8 cups/day
- If wet food has 250 calories/can: 282 ÷ 250 = 1.1 cans/day
- Split into 2-3 meals

## Measuring Portions Accurately

### Best Methods:

1. **Kitchen Scale (Most Accurate)**
   - Weigh food in grams or ounces
   - Most precise method
   - Recommended for weight management

2. **Proper Measuring Cup**
   - Use actual measuring cup, not random cup
   - Level off, don't pack down
   - Check cup size (8 oz = 1 cup)

3. **Food-Specific Scoops**
   - Some brands provide scoops
   - Check scoop size
   - May not be accurate for portion control

### Common Mistakes:

- ❌ Using random cups or mugs
- ❌ Estimating portions
- ❌ Packing food into measuring cup
- ❌ Not accounting for treats
- ❌ Forgetting to adjust when switching foods

## Adjusting Portions Over Time

### When to Increase Portions:

- Pet is losing weight (unintentionally)
- Increased activity level
- Growth phase (puppies/kittens)
- Pregnancy or nursing
- Cold weather (outdoor pets)
- Recovery from illness

### When to Decrease Portions:

- Pet is gaining weight
- Decreased activity level
- Aging (senior pets)
- Spaying/neutering (reduces metabolism)
- Hot weather (less active)
- Health conditions requiring weight loss

### Adjustment Guidelines:

- Make changes gradually (10-20% at a time)
- Wait 2-4 weeks between adjustments
- Monitor weight weekly during adjustments
- Keep detailed records
- Consult veterinarian for significant changes

## Treats and Extras

### Treat Guidelines:

- **Limit treats to <10% of daily calories**
- Count treats in daily calorie total
- Use healthy, low-calorie treats
- Consider using kibble as treats
- Avoid high-calorie human foods

### Calculating Treat Calories:

If your pet needs 800 calories/day:
- 10% = 80 calories for treats
- That's about 2-3 small training treats
- Or 1/4 cup of kibble used as treats

**Remember:** Treats add up quickly. A few extra treats can easily add 100+ calories, leading to weight gain over time.

## Feeding Schedule Recommendations

### Dogs:

**Puppies (under 6 months):**
- 3-4 meals per day
- Regular schedule
- Consistent times

**Adult Dogs:**
- 2 meals per day (morning and evening)
- 12-hour intervals ideal
- Consistent schedule

**Senior Dogs:**
- 2-3 smaller meals
- May need more frequent feeding
- Easier to digest

### Cats:

**Kittens (under 6 months):**
- 3-4 meals per day
- Free-feeding acceptable for some
- Monitor intake

**Adult Cats:**
- 2-4 meals per day
- Some prefer grazing (multiple small meals)
- Consistent schedule

**Senior Cats:**
- 2-3 meals per day
- May need more frequent, smaller meals
- Monitor appetite

## Monitoring Your Pet's Weight

### Body Condition Scoring:

**Ideal (Score 4-5/9):**
- Ribs easily felt but not visible
- Waist visible from above
- Abdomen tucks up from side
- Good muscle tone

**Underweight (Score 1-3/9):**
- Ribs, spine, hip bones visible
- No body fat
- Obvious waist and abdominal tuck
- Increase portions

**Overweight (Score 6-9/9):**
- Ribs difficult to feel
- No waist visible
- Abdomen sags
- Reduce portions

### Weighing Schedule:

- **Monthly** for healthy pets
- **Weekly** during weight loss/gain programs
- **Same time of day** for consistency
- **Same scale** for accuracy
- **Record weights** to track trends

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Pets:

- Feed separately to monitor intake
- Prevent food stealing
- Different portions for different sizes
- Use separate bowls and spaces

### Free-Feeding:

- **Not recommended** for most pets
- Leads to overeating and obesity
- Makes portion control impossible
- Some cats can self-regulate (rare)

### Automatic Feeders:

- Can help with portion control
- Consistent feeding times
- Prevents overfeeding
- Good for busy schedules
- Still need to monitor weight
